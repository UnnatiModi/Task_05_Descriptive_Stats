    "Q1: What team had the highest number of wins between 2003 and 2023?  \n",
    "A:New England Patriots  \n",
    "Accuracy:Verified correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2:In which year was the average points per team the highest?  \n",
    "A:2013  \n",
    "Accuracy:Incorrect — actual highest was 2018.\n",
    "\n",
    "Insightful Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "Q1:Is there a correlation between points scored and win percentage?  \n",
    "A:Yes, teams with higher points generally have higher win percentages.  \n",
    "Accuracy:Supported by visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2:Are turnovers a significant factor in determining wins?  \n",
    "A:Yes, teams with fewer turnovers tend to win more games.  \n",
    "Accuracy:Verified through scatterplot.\n",
    "\n",
    "Comparative Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "Q1:Which team had more total wins — Patriots or Steelers?  \n",
    "A:Patriots  \n",
    "Accuracy:Confirmed by dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2:Do NFC teams score more points than AFC teams on average?  \n",
    "A:Yes.  \n",
    "Accuracy:This wasn't verified in current analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reasoning-Based Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "Q1:Could high-scoring teams still lose frequently?  \n",
    "A:Yes, if their defense allows too many points.  \n",
    "Accuracy:Theoretically valid, but needs points allowed data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2:Does consistency in yards per play guarantee more wins?  \n",
    "A:Possibly, but it needs to be combined with low turnovers and strong defense.  \n",
    "Accuracy:Reasonable assumption.\n",
